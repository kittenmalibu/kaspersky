You're scheming on a thing, it's CYBERTAGE! : Russia's Exploitation of Kaspersky

Researching if Kaspersky Lab, Russian cybersecurity firm, facilitated Russian hacking attempts on the US government's computers. 
I explored the allegations of Russia's exploitation of Kaspersky for hacking, and uncovered evidence to confirm my hypothesis.



Election night, Nov 8, 2016.

I did as I always do on election night, watched the coverage on all the channels, flipping from CNN to MSNBC to local news. I was fully expecting Hillary Rodham Clinton to be the first female elected as President of the United States. But to my dismay, as the night went on, the strong numbers she had early in the evening were being chipped away by Trump. It was kind of a weird feeling, like I was watching a computer virus slowly overtake my computer. I couldn't stop it, only watch as it became the blue screen of death. Trump was declared the winner of the election due to the Electoral College numbers, despite the fact that he had 2.9M less votes than Clinton.  I remember a horrible, sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Could this REALLY BE how America voted? It was frightening.  

Cut to Nov. 2019. I am taking a Cybersecurity class with the Rochester Institute of Technology via edX. The instructor is talking about all of the major data breaches that had occurred...and we came to the Kaspersky Lab data breach of 2015. Allegedly, Kaspersky Lab had been infected with the Duqu 2.0 trojan, an iteration of the Stuxnet virus that infected one fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges previously in 2010. Eugene Kaspersky claimed that It was Israel, China, even Romanian hackers.   

Well, the Israeli Intelligence Service (Unit 8200) possibly did use Duqu 2.0 to infiltrate Kaspersky.. and what they found was very interesting. Unit 8200 notified the US Government that Kaspersky anti virus software was being used by the FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation) as their own private global search engine. Kremlin agents were discovered in real time to be sweeping computers with the anti virus for American cyberweapons, and extracting any matching files. 

It was then claimed that Kaspersky DELIBERATELY engineered its software to allow Russian spies to use it for computer surveillance globally. The fact that the United Stated government used Kaspersky anti virus on computers at the NSA (National Security Agency) was incredible and quite unbelievable. Previously, on September 1, 2014, there was another security incident at the NSA. Kaspersky reported that its anti virus on a home computer with an IP address in Baltimore, Maryland appeared to have a trojan malware called Smoke Bot (or Smoke Loader),  created by a Russian hacker in 2012 and used by the Equation Group. It created a back door (secret portal) onto a NSA’s employee's pc, who was part of the elite hacker unit Tailored Access Operations. The employee allegedly pirated Microsoft office, and installed malware in the process.

So, what exactly is the truth? Is Kaspersky the victim in these breaches, or is he the facilitator of them?
Let's explore the background on its CEO and founder, Eugene Kaspersky.

Kaspersky was born on October 4, 1965 in Novorossiysk, Soviet Union. His father was an engineer and his mother a historical archivist.  He developed an early interest in math and technology, and his free time included reading math books. At age 14, Kaspersky began attending a Moscow University run boarding school,  A.N. Kolmogorov. 

Kaspersky entered a five-year program with The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School at 16. He graduated with a degree in Mathematical Engineering and Computer Technology in 1987.  Kaspersky served the Soviet military intelligence service as a software engineer after  #graduation.
Kaspersky ten years later, founded Kaspersky Lab in 1997.  Due to the company's antivirus software, the firm grew to become a global leader in cybersecurity solutions. Kaspersky anti virus gained significant worldwide appeal due to its advanced threat detection and comprehensive protection against emerging cyber threats. However, in recent years, Kaspersky Lab has faced intense scrutiny and allegations of being involved in cyber espionage operations conducted by the Russian government.


Supporting Evidence:
Multiple incidents and investigations have contributed to the mounting concerns about Kaspersky's alleged role in aiding Russian hacking attempts on US government entities. Notably, the  2015 breach of the US National Security Agency (NSA) by Russian hackers, their subsequent theft of classified cyber attack tools, and Kaspersky's presumed involvement in this are the basis for heightened suspicions.

Furthermore, in 2017, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive banning the use of Kaspersky Lab software across federal agencies, highlighting concerns over potential vulnerabilities it posed. The directive cited the "information security risks presented by the use of Kaspersky products on federal information systems." These risks were believed to stem from the alleged ties between Kaspersky and the Russian government, leading to widespread distrust in its ability to protect against advanced cyber threats.
However, after doing some deep, dark dives into the depths of the internet, I have uncovered information linking Kaspersky to the willing infiltration of United States government, the hacking of Hillary Clinton's emails, and subsequently, the 2016 election. 

Bloomberg has uncovered emails showing that Kaspersky developed products for the FSB, in addition to accompanying agents on raids.
Eugene Kaspersky responded to the claims about the Lab’s ties to the Kremlin via Reddit. He says that they are “unfounded conspiracy theories” and “total BS.".   Unfortunately for me, the U.S. government hasn’t disclosed any of the email evidence. Bloomberg Businessweek have also obtained internal company emails that show that Kaspersky Lab and the FSB have a much closer working relationship than it cares to admit. At the spy agency’s behest,  Kaspersky has developed security technology and worked on joint projects that Eugene Kaspersky would not want to go public, as he knows such information would be extremely damaging to the company. The discovered emails are the exact opposite of how Kaspersky claims to be without any  influence from Putin or Moscow. The previously unreported emails, from a thread dated October 2009, are between Eugene Kaspersky and senior staff. In Russian, Kaspersky outlines a secret a project initiated  a year earlier “per a big request on the Lubyanka side,” (referring to the FSB offices). The emails were confirmed to be authentic by Kaspersky Labs. 

The emails showed that per Kaspersky,  the project for the FSB was intended to turn the anti-DDoS technology into a mass-market product for businesses. “In the future the project may become one of the items on the list of services that we provide to corporate customers,” he wrote. DDoS protection service is now marketed via Kaspersky Labs to large companies, directly installing sensors inside the networks of their customers. Kaspersky has stated that the software had the purpose of protecting clients (including the Russian Government) from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Kaspersky Lab would assist with “active countermeasures,” in addition to coordinating with internet hosting companies in order to locate bad actors and block their attacks.  Kaspersky advised his staff to keep this capability a secret due to its sensitive nature. Kaspersky wrote “The project includes both technology to protect against attacks (filters) as well as interaction with the hosters (‘spreading’ of sacrifice) and active countermeasures (about which, we keep quiet) and so on.”

Among security professionals, “active countermeasures” often refers to shutting down a hackers computers with malware or other methods. Kaspersky may have been referring to a physical halting of a hacker. The Kaspersky anti-DDoS system, as per a company insider, consists of two options. The first are  techniques that are traditionally defensive, such as rerouting malicious traffic to servers that are able to withstand it. Part two is unconventional and essentially banging down the doors of said hackers;  Kaspersky provides the FSB with real-time intelligence on the hackers’ location and sends experts to accompany the FSB and Russian police when the raids are conducted. The person familiar with the system says that's what Kaspersky was referring to in the emails.
Kaspersky Lab’s chief legal officer, Igor Chekunov, was the project lead. A former policeman and KGB officer, Chekunov's role included gathering and  identifying data from customers’ computers; he's the main contact for technical support to the FSB and other Russian agencies.  Ruslan Stoyanov, the Kaspersky employee whose technology underpinned the company’s anti-DDoS efforts, used to ride along with Russian agents on raids. Previously, Stoyanov was working in the cybercrime unit of the Interior Ministry . He and a senior FSB cyber investigator were arrested on treason charges in December 2018.  Kaspersky stated that the case involved allegations of wrongdoing taking place before Stoyanov had ever worked for the company. 

The company has commented “When statements are taken out of context, anything can be manipulated to serve an agenda. Kaspersky Lab has always acknowledged that it provides appropriate products and services to governments around the world to protect those organizations from cyberthreats, but it does not have any unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia.”


Konstantin Kozlovsky, a hacker from the Lurk group, was arrested with others by the FSB for “creating a malicious program through which more than 1 billion 700 million rubles were stolen from the accounts of Russian financial institutions." Kozlovsky, said in his testimony, among other things, that in 2008 he was recruited by the FSB to perform many tasks, which included the  hacking of the US Democratic Party servers.

Previously, there were two Russian groups who were involved in attacks of political and military targets overseas: Cozy Bear, presumably managed by the FSB, and Fancy Bear, directed by the GRU.  

Kozlovsky posted proof on his Facebook profile in August 2017, The items posted have been confirmed as authentic by various sources. It is hard to determine how true they are, but there is previously unknown and undisclosed information among the evidence posted.   Kozlovsky’s testimony, including those given in handwritten form, is in the evidence posted. I have enclosed any evidence I could find, including the letters, along with an English translation.

RE:  FSB curators & the hacking of American servers

While studying computer technology, I communicated on numerous Internet forums. In 2008, I entered into a dialogue about the vulnerability of email services. During the discussion, I started a dispute for $500, as a result of which I demonstrated the vulnerability using the example of one e-mail, posting the password for public viewing on the forum. Next, I demanded money from the arguer, offering to meet at an appointed place. Two people approached me; Having determined that I was the specialist who hacked the mail, they showed me the ID of an FSB officer and persistently asked me to get into the car.

I was brought, as I later found out, to the courtyard of the FSB department for the Sverdlovsk region (Ekaterinburg). I spent two days in a 3 by 3 meter room. They didn't give us any food, only two times of water in an aluminum bowl. They brought a bucket to relieve themselves. FSB officers were given a choice: work with them or go to prison for hacking mail. I agreed by signing the paper.

Over the years of cooperation, I completed many tasks, Ilya was my supervisor, gave tasks and supervised, supplied with technical and software tools, patronized in matters with law enforcement officers.


In recent years, the focus has been on American and EU servers. I completed the assignment to hack the US Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's correspondence successfully, transferring the data on the hard drive to FSB officer Ilya (~850 GB in compressed form with video recordings of the hack).

The “events” in relation to the United States and the countries of the European Union affected gaining access (hacking) to: the largest industrial enterprises; government and military structures; financial institutions (banks/exchanges); sports organizations (FIFA, Olympic Committee, WADA, etc.). Nuclear power plants, hydroelectric power plants, state district power plants, major media outlets and their social media accounts. networks (once, on behalf of the FSB, I made a story about the death of M.S. Gorbachev in the RIA Novosti microblog); and etc (!).

After hacking, I had to transfer remote access to the FSB officers. According to their order, perform modification/blocking/deleting/downloading information, identify personal data of employees and employees (as was done with those who investigate the Boeing plane crash in Ukraine).

After the hack, I transferred remote access to FSB officers. On their orders, he modified information and identified personal data of employees (as was done with those investigating the Boeing plane crash in Ukraine)
There was also a “Russian” work: the company “9 Val” Andrei Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun, engaged in collection services, and in fact (as it seemed to me) by raiding against Russian companies and others is hardly legal actions.

The stumbling block in this “collaboration” was the task of creating a “red button”. An order to create a technical solution that would allow the FSB to carry out massive destruction of the infrastructure of the above US and EU facilities.

I had sufficient abilities, but, realizing the consequences of inevitable human casualties, I refused. I don’t want to have anything to do with the start of World War 3.

After the refusal, I was asked yet; The next "proposal" was accompanied by "your good refusal will not end." Then Ilya disappeared. After a while I was detained. The military head of the Russian Guard was delivered to Moscow. They appointed 150 investigators on business, promised the "pancreas". Computer equipment and data confirming hacks are now in the FSB of the Russian Federation. And I am in the Kremlin Central (pre-trial detention center No. 1), a prison for political prisoners, where the well-known Mr. Magnitsky was killed, Khodorkovsky and employees of Yukos, Mavrodi, the State Emergency Committee, and the Corruption in the Organ traffic police were killed .

I ask the world community to respond.

Realize the degree of threat from the policies of the Russian Authorities.

Do not remain indifferent in the fate of me and my family, providing political asylum in any Western country.

Help get rid of the shackles of the regime.

RE:Hacks of American servers


In 2008, I was recruited by the Russian FSB. On their instructions, he carried out tasks to hack Western IT infrastructure.

On May 18, 2016, the FSB of the Russian Federation, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, detained me on suspicion of embezzling funds from correspondent accounts of Russian banks.

On November 1, 2016, while in custody (SIZO 99/1), I wrote to my wife... and lawyer... letters in which I exposed the Russian authorities and myself as the direct perpetrator of cyber attacks against the US and the EU. In particular, he provided information about the hacking of the US Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's correspondence.

None of the letters reached the recipients. The investigation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, immediately before the US presidential elections, did not allow letters proving the involvement of Russians in cyber attacks on the United States.

On December 9, 2016, the investigation sent me for a psychiatric examination, contrary to the already existing decision on my sanity (dated November 29, 2016). The investigation does not provide a copy of the decision.

Messages about sending me to the Institute. Serbsky appeared in some media, but without specifying the reason: letters.

The Russian authorities are doing their best to prevent the world community from communicating the truth about the circumstances of the cyber attacks.

My detention is directly related to the isolation of information about the expansionist actions of the Russian Federation towards Western countries, interference in the US election processes,

About Dokuchaev


On May 16, 2017, during the extension of my detention in the Moscow City Court, I spoke on record about how I had worked for the state for many years. But they don’t believe me, since it is very profitable to sue us for the amounts that ended up in some other pockets. I spoke about D. Dokuchaev (an operative from the FSB CIB, arrested for treason, who at one time often visited the Mazafaca (Support) forum - the largest hacker forum aimed at attacks on financial institutions, asked for a confrontation with him. But my testimony are of no interest to anyone, since, apparently, they violate the plans of big people.


When they brought me a resolution from the Moscow City Court for review, it turned out that my words there too were distorted, about which a complaint was filed, which the judge did not satisfy. This is what motivates me to reach out to the general public.

I refused lawyers because I consider my case to be fabricated, there is no evidence other than the testimony of a drug addict whom I once helped. I am also charged with leading an organized crime group (Article 210, part 1) consisting of 50 people. The only truth is that I strictly followed the instructions of my FSB handlers and believed that I was acting in the interests of the state.

The fact that these testimonies actually belong to Kozlovsky is confirmed by a number of documents - such as, for example, these:

About the arrested manager of "Kaspersky Laboratory" Ruslana Stoyanov

In May 2016, Mr. Stoyanov personally visited several addresses (in EKB) where searches were conducted. Investigators called him "Casper". In this regard, the questions are: how legitimate is his presence and his actions during these searches? How can you be sure that a person who is undoubtedly highly qualified has not erased, for example, any traces? Or added something? Mr. Stoyanov was arrested for treason, how can you be sure of the correctness of the examinations conducted by him?! How can an accusation be based on them?!

Mr. Kaspersky: "We do not work with the FSB"!?




The protocol of the hearings on the measure of suppression with the testimony of Kozlovsky, where he talks about the fabrication of the case by FSB employees and "Kaspersky Laboratory", in addition to other certificates and letters...




Conclusion:

Based on the information I have provided here, corresponding links, and photographic evidence, It is clear that Kaspersky has been proven to not only infiltrate our US government computers and servers, but ALSO any computer worldwide that has used Kaspersky anti virus as protection from hackers. It has been proven that he actively worked with the Russian Government to create software that was essentially spyware, in addition to proactively recruiting/blackmailing hackers to do the bidding for the Kremlin.
